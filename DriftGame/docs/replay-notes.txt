A Replay should embed the following information:

	- track level
	- difficulty level
	- car type (graphics)
	- car model (physical properties)
	- elapsed time to complete the track


Object entities for a successfull replaying system:

	- Recorder
		* It will record the necessary per-tick information needed to replay
		the player's car behavior at the most accurate level of precision.

		* Any applied effect, such as skid marks, particles.. will NOT be
		shown on the ghostcar.

		* The recorded data should be encoded such as it will be fast to decode
		and very light to transport.

		* the produced output will be a serializable object, Replay, embedding
		any information needed to successfully replay the car's behavior.

	- Ghost
		given one or more Replay objects, it will manage to decode and replay
		the actions described by the supplied Replay data.
