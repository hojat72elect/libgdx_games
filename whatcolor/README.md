## How to play
You see a color pattern and then a color disappears. Click the missing color on the bottom until you loose.
Every correct color pick gives you 1 point. Reach 10 points or more for the next level.

# Getting started

Take a look at the official libGDX [documentation](https://libgdx.com/dev/) on how to get started with libGDX and how to setup the project.  
Or just contact me at info@simondalvai.com, I'll help you to get started and update this README, so that others can also contribute. But until that doesn't happen, I'm too lazy to write a setup documentation.

## Run it on your device
You can install and make release and debug releases with the gradlew wrapper located in `src/gradlew`.  
To run it on your attached device run
```
./gradlew installDebug
```
To make a debug aab build run
```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
